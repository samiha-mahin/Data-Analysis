        "\n",
        "**Imbalanced data** refers to a classification problem where the classes (or categories) are **not represented equally**. One class has **significantly more samples** than the other(s). This is common in many real-world problems, especially when the **event of interest is rare**.\n",

        "\n",
        "### Why It’s a Problem\n",
        "\n",
        "Most machine learning models assume a **roughly equal distribution** of classes. When one class dominates, the model can become **biased** towards the majority class and ignore the minority class, leading to poor performance, especially in detecting the rare class (which is often the more important one).\n",
